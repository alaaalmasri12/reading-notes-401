# Which Questions do you Ask in Retrospectives?

Asking questions is a technique that is easy to learn, but the effectiveness depends on the questions that you ask to the team.

**Four Key Questions**

When I start with a team that is new to retrospectives, I often use The four key questions. These questions come from the book Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews, by Norm Kerth. The questions are:

1. What did we do well, that if we don’t discuss we might forget?
2. What did we learn?
3. What should we do differently next time?
4. What still puzzles us?


**Valuable Retrospective Questions**
Working with agile and non-agile teams, I’ve been doing project evaluations, audits, assessments using the CMMI and the People-CMM, retrospectives, and many other kinds of feedback sessions. Below are some questions that I often use, that have proved to help teams finding things that they could improve upon:

* What helps you to be successful as a team?
* How did you do this sprint?
* Where and when did it go wrong in this sprint?
* What do you expect, from who?
* Which tools or techniques proved to be useful? Which not?
* What is your biggest impediment?
* If you could change 1 thing, what would it be?
* What caused the problems that you had in this sprint?
* What’s keeping you awake at night?
* Which things went smoothly in this sprint? Which didn’t?

**Asking why?**
One of the most valuable questions that I have experienced in retrospectives is asking why? Some examples are:

* Why did you do it like this?
* Why did this (or didn’t this) work for you?
* Why do you consider something to be important?
* Why do you feel this way?
* Why did you decide to work together on this?
